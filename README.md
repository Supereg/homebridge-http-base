This module is designed to be used as dependency for http based homebridge plugins. It exposes clients for http and mqtt.

It's generally used for my `homebridge-http-*` plugins like:
* [homebridge-http-switch](https://github.com/Supereg/homebridge-http-switch)
* [homebridge-http-lightbulb](https://github.com/Supereg/homebridge-http-lightbulb)
* [homebridge-http-outlet](https://github.com/Supereg/homebridge-http-outlet)
* [homebridge-http-humidity-sensor](https://github.com/Supereg/homebridge-http-humidity-sensor)
* [homebridge-http-temperature-sensor](https://github.com/Supereg/homebridge-http-temperature-sensor)
